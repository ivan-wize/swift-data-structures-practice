# Sample Dockerfile for building and testing an iOS application
# Note: macOS is required for iOS development. Docker does not natively support macOS images,
# so this file assumes usage of a macOS-compatible system for build dependencies like Xcode.

# Base image
FROM swift:5.7  # Use a Swift image as the base (ensure compatibility with your project)

# Metadata about the image
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <youremail@example.com>"
LABEL description="Dockerfile for building and testing an iOS application"

# Install dependencies required for iOS development
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    curl \
    unzip \
    cmake \
    ninja-build \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set environment variables for Xcode and build tools
ENV DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Define a volume for shared data between host and container
# This can be used to persist build outputs or logs
VOLUME /app/output

# Expose a port (if the app requires a local server, e.g., for testing APIs or UI)
EXPOSE 8080

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the iOS project files into the container
COPY . /app

# Install CocoaPods dependencies (if your project uses CocoaPods)
RUN gem install cocoapods && pod install --project-directory=/app

# Build the iOS app (adjust the scheme and workspace as needed)
RUN xcodebuild -workspace ColdPlunge.xcworkspace \
    -scheme ColdPlunge \
    -sdk iphonesimulator \
    -configuration Debug \
    build

# Define a health check to monitor the container's status
# Replace the `curl` command with an appropriate health check for your app
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1

# Command to run tests (default entry point)
CMD ["xcodebuild", "test", "-workspace", "ColdPlunge.xcworkspace", "-scheme", "ColdPlunge", "-sdk", "iphonesimulator"]

# Notes:
# - The `VOLUME` command allows sharing the `/app/output` folder with the host, useful for persisting build results.
# - The `EXPOSE` command declares that port 8080 is intended for external connections.
# - The `HEALTHCHECK` monitors the app's health by pinging an HTTP endpoint. Replace this with a valid endpoint for your app.
# - As iOS development requires macOS and Xcode, this setup assumes you're using macOS-compatible Docker setups.

# Additional Commands (Optional):
# - Use `COPY` or `ADD` to include files or directories required for build-time configurations.
# - Use `ARG` for build-time variables to pass specific configurations or settings.
