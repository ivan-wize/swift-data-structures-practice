# Sample Dockerfile for building and testing an iOS application
# Note: macOS is required for iOS development. Docker does not natively support macOS images,
# so this file assumes usage of a macOS-compatible system for build dependencies like Xcode.

# Base image
FROM swift:5.7  # Use a Swift image as the base (ensure compatibility with your project)

# Install dependencies required for iOS development
# (Requires Xcode command line tools installed on the host system)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    curl \
    unzip \
    cmake \
    ninja-build \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set environment variables for Xcode and build tools
ENV DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the iOS project files into the container
COPY . /app

# Install CocoaPods dependencies (if your project uses CocoaPods)
RUN gem install cocoapods && pod install --project-directory=/app

# Build the iOS app (adjust the scheme and workspace as needed)
RUN xcodebuild -workspace ColdPlunge.xcworkspace \
    -scheme ColdPlunge \
    -sdk iphonesimulator \
    -configuration Debug \
    build

# Command to run tests (optional)
CMD ["xcodebuild", "test", "-workspace", "ColdPlunge.xcworkspace", "-scheme", "ColdPlunge", "-sdk", "iphonesimulator"]

# Notes:
# - This Dockerfile assumes you're running it on a macOS system with Xcode installed.
# - Modify the base image and dependencies to match your specific iOS project's needs.
# - Docker on macOS for iOS development requires access to the host system for Xcode and simulators.
